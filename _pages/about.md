Konstantinos P. Chatzipapas is a Medical Physicist, currently based at Brest, France. He has been working with the consequencies of radiation to living matter, using computational techniques. Both Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are in the menu, with a mean focus on the quantification of cellular damage. He is keen to working with interested researchers in all levels (i.e., PhD candidates, Post-Doc researchers, senior researchers).

Konstantinos is part of the [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) and the [Geant4-DNA](http://geant4-dna.org/) collaboration, and is the contact person for AI developments with Geant4-DNA.

Anyone interested for collaboration could contact me at my e-mail: konstantinos.chatzipapas[at]univ-brest.fr
